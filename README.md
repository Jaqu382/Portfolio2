Portfolio created for UCF DIG4639C

_Option 2: New Project, 3 components._
"Create ONE (1) new React Native project using React Native Elements and React Navigation (using Expo). It should include at least 3 screens and two new components (that don't include the screens themselves)."

This application is supposed to be an inventory management system. Users should be able to login, view current inventory, and add or remove inventory

There are three screens the user can interact with, a login screen, an Inventory screen, and a Stock screen.

While initially there was only supposed to be two components, I expanded to four during implementation. MainInventory and MainStock render a list of components. Product renders all items in inventory and stockItem renders interactible cards that can be used to add or remove items from inventory.
