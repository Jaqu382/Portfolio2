This application is supposed to be an inventory management system. Users should be able to login, view current inventory, and add or remove inventory

There are three screens the user can interact with, a login screen, an Inventory screen, and a Stock screen.

While initially there was only supposed to be two components, I expanded to four during implementation. MainInventory and MainStock render a list of components. Product renders all items in inventory and stockItem renders interactible cards that can be used to add or remove items from inventory.
